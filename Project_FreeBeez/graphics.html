      What is graphic design?
      <br><br>
Put simply, graphic design is the art and craft of creating visual content that communicates a concept, an idea or a brand message to the public. Logos, artworks, drawings, illustrations, cards, emails and a whole paraphernalia of designs are all around us. You can see them in print and digital media, in shops, restaurants and cafes, on billboards, books and magazines, in the apps we use, the sites we visit and the physical and digital products we buy.

How to hire top graphic designers?
<br>
<br>
A captivating visual presence is very important whether you’re a business or a non-commercial entity. Your potential audiences are already forming an opinion and deciding whether to interact with you based on what they see, long before you’ve had a chance to say or write something. So it’s imperative to carefully select the right freelancer to meet your needs and keep you within budget. There are many different areas in which graphic designers specialize so if you want to hire the right talent to meet the requirements of your particular project, here are some easy to follow tips and tricks.
<br>
<br>
<br>
How much does it cost to hire a graphic designer<br>
<br>
There is no simple answer to this question as graphic design is not a commodity or a product that has an exact way to be measured or priced. The great thing about Fiverr is that you can find a freelance graphic designer for any budget, starting from just $5 per gig and going up to hundreds or thousands of dollars for more complex and time and resource consuming requirements. However, there are a number of factors that will influence the final price of the project such as the level of experience of the seller (from novices to Top Rated and Pro Sellers), the number or service options included in the gig, delivery times, number of revisions and whether any extras might need to be added at some point.

     How do I write a good creative design brief?<br>
      <br>
The creative brief is a key document that essentially defines the objectives, scope and key milestones of a design project. It gives the required information to the freelance graphic designer on what needs to be done, who the target audience will be, what key message(s) need to be communicated, what deliverables are expected, by when (deadlines and milestones). The creative brief is basically the blueprint that you’ll need to agree with your internal stakeholders, business partners or colleagues (or if you are a one-person-show - find a friend or someone you trust to use as a sounding board) and then present to the freelancer to guide, inspire them and ensure they deliver the best possible creative results.<br>
<br>
What’s the best way to hire a designer in less than 48 hours?<br>
<br>
Finding a good graphic designer is very important for the way your business and brand is presented to your target audience so you need to be very careful in who you put your trust in. You will need to get to grips with some graphic design 101’s in order to become better at selection. Having said that, we know that sometimes there are business emergencies and you might find yourself in a situation when you need to hire a professional logo designer, illustration artist, front-end/UX or web designer or any type of freelance graphic designer in a hurry.<br>
<br>
What makes graphic design so important?<br>
<br>
We live in a visual society so images, packaging, signage, illustrations, websites, apps and social media all vie for our attention, making it very challenging to become noticeable let alone memorable amongst the overload of visual stimuli. In a nutshell, the most important mission that graphic design plays is communication. Communication of ideas and messages, with the ultimate objective of elicit, prompt or evoke an action or an emotion (which will become an action in the future). So a good graphic designer will build your logo, create your email campaign or company stationery.<br>
